### Routes

Your server should have the following end-points:

```http
GET /api 
# Serves an HTML page with documentation for all the available endpoints
```

```http
GET /api/topics
# Get all the topics
```

```http
GET /api/topics/:topic_slug/articles
# Return all the articles for a certain topic
# e.g: `/api/topics/football/articles`
```

```http
POST /api/topics/:topic_slug/articles
# Add a new article to a topic. This route requires a JSON body with title and body key value pairs
# e.g: `{ "title": "new article", "body": "This is my new article content", "created_by": "user_id goes here"}`
```

```http
GET /api/articles
# Returns all the articles
```

```http
GET /api/articles/:article_id
# Get an individual article
```

```http
GET /api/articles/:article_id/comments
# Get all the comments for a individual article
```

```http
POST /api/articles/:article_id/comments
# Add a new comment to an article. This route requires a JSON body with body and created_by key value pairs
# e.g: `{"body": "This is my new comment", "created_by": "user_id goes here"}`
```

```http
PATCH /api/articles/:article_id
# Increment or Decrement the votes of an article by one. This route requires a vote query of 'up' or 'down'
# e.g: `/api/articles/:article_id?vote=up`
```

```http
PATCH /api/comments/:comment_id
# Increment or Decrement the votes of a comment by one. This route requires a vote query of 'up' or 'down'
# e.g: `/api/comments/:comment_id?vote=down`
```

```http
DELETE /api/comments/:comment_id
# Deletes a comment
```

```http
DELETE /api/articles/:article_id
# Deletes an article
```

```http
GET /api/users/:username
# e.g: `/api/users/mitch123`
# Returns a JSON object with the profile data for the specified user.
```

NOTE: When it comes to building your front end you'll find it extremely useful if your POST comment endpoint returns the new comment with the created_by property populated with the corresponding user object.
